\noindent I would firstly like to acknowledge my supervisor, Dr. Sarah Wise, for her invaluable expertise and guidance throughout my entire research process. Her enthusiasm for this topic has been incredibly inspirational and motivating.  \\

\noindent This work was also greatly supported by various members of the humanitarian mapping community. In particular, Jorieke Vyncke, of Médecins Sans Frontières, provided ongoing feedback and subject matter expertise. Raphael Brechard, of Médecins Sans Frontières, and Andrew Braye, of the British Red Cross, also provided valuable feedback as I developed my research ideas. I am also grateful for the work that has been conducted by the Missing Maps community, Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, and wider OpenStreetMap community, to provide the data and infrastructure that forms the basis for this research. \\

\noindent I would not have been able to conduct this research without the OSHDB API, developed by the Heidelberg Institute for Geoinformation Technology. I am particularly appreciative of the technical assistance provided by Rafael Trolio.  \\

\noindent I am also grateful for the support from CASA faculty and fellow students, and from Professor Anahid Basiri and Dr. Andrew Maclachlan in particular, for guiding me in selecting an appropriate topic for this dissertation.
