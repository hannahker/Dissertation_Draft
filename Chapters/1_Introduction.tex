\label{chapterlabel1}

\section{Project context and justification}

\textit{What is OSM and why is it useful in a humanitarian context? Why is data maintenance an important topic to consider with respect to humanitarian mapping? How will the outcomes of this work be relevant and useful?}

\section{Scope of work}

\textit{Outline case study approach. This is an initial exploratory study. We will be offering recommendations, but will not be making broad generalizations aout phenomena.}

\section{Research question and objectives}

In this work we explore the following research question: \textit{What are the characteristics of data production during selected humanitarian mapping campaigns and to what extent is this data maintained after the end of each campaign?}

To address this question, we will pursue the following research objectives: 

\textit{How can we identify data maintenance following humanitarian mapping, and what factors relating to the dynamics of data production are related to greater data maintenance?}

\section{Research outline}

\textit{Signposting paragraphs to broadly outline each of the chapters. What will be discussed in each chapter?}
