Future work should look more closely at the relationship between factors such as mapping campaign style, duration of campaign, and volume of contributors; and data maintenance over time. While our work does not provide any conclusive results, we hypothesize that longer-term campaigns with sustained contributor engagement would lead to a greater prevalence of data maintenance over time. As has been done in several past efforts (eg. Dittus, Anderson, Quattrone, etc.), future work could also look more closely at the characteristics of contributors, such as experience level and retention over time, and see how this relates to how much data is maintained. 

consider factors that contribute to more data maintenance at the entity level (rather than the campaign level) - could do a regression analysis - eg. GWR to see if location has an impact, type of entity, date created, etc...
